# Brick Breaker

This repository contains an implementation of the [Brick Breaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick_Breaker) game 
based on [a tutorial on MDN website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript). 
nlike the original tutorial, we have taken an Object-Oriented approach to the design and implementation of the game.

You will find a demo of the original tutorial [here](https://jsfiddle.net/raymondjplante/b3z2Lpu9/). 
Feel free to play the game and inspect the source code.
